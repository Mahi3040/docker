docker pull ubuntu ==   To Pull image 
docker create --name osapp01 ubuntu == To create container
docker start osapp01
This command starts the container, but if the container has nothing to do (no foreground process), 
it will:

✅ Start
⏳ Run default command (/bin/bash or similar)
🛑 Immediately exit — because there's no terminal or process keeping it alive

docker run -it --name osapp01 ubuntu == i will connect and log into the default shell and exited once we are out
container is also stopped

docker run -dit --name osapp02 ubuntu == it will run container in the background. and you can do exec  later also
-d == detached mode 
-it == interactive mode 

docker attach osapp01 == attach to the already running container shell and container stopped once we exit from terminal 
docker start -ai osapp01 == start and attach to it. stopped once exit from shell
