Copying file from local system to a contianer

docker cp c:/test/filename.txt web01:/test

To check the operations perfomed by the system and  user after container creation 
docker diff web01

Note:
We have docker file locally and image is created. (tracking is fine about image is created ).
but what if we pushed image to repository and someone downlaods and use then how do they know how image is created.
for this problem we have solution 

comand 
docker history image name (lists Dockerfile instructions)

docker logs container name 

docker inspect container name 

cleaning commands :
================
docker rm web01

docker rmi nginx

docker image prune === remove all unused/corrupted images 

docker network prune 
docker volume prune
docker system prune - stopped containers and images , net , volumes
