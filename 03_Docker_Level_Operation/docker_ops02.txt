Using docker commit is great for quick image creation or debugging, but it's not best
practice for production. Instead: 
Use a Dockerfile for reproducibility
Keep your builds version-controlled

docker commit webapp01 == create  image from running/stopped container 
docker cp <source file path> container name:< container folder name >
