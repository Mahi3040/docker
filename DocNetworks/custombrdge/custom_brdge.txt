with default bridge you can access the other containers in the same bridge with ip address 

docker exec -u root -it webapp01 bash
apt update
apt install iputils-ping -y

create a custom bridge if want DNS resolution 

docker network create --driver bridge my_bridge
docker network ls


docker run -dit --name httpd02 --net=my_bridge httpd
 docker exec -it web01 ping httpd02 == works but both should be part of same network
